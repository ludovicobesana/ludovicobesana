## 🔄 Repository refresh plan
I'm working to ensure *all* public projects on this profile are complete, polished, and truly valuable.
Each month, I dedicate time to one or more repositories: fixing bugs, updating dependencies, improving tests and documentation.

  👉 You can follow my progress by **following me on GitHub** and/or checking [this public dashboard](https://github.com/users/ludovicobesana/projects/8).

I'm a 🐞 QA Engineer and 💻 Developer who loves to automate and find bugs. 

I'm a 🐧 Linux lover, but 🍎 macOS is so beautiful that it can't not be used.

I'm currently working on:
-   :octocat: [GitHub](https://github.com/ludovicobesana?tab=repositories): To ensure that you can find useful resources here 


Here are the languages, frameworks, and libraries that I'm most comfortable using:

-   🐍 Python: Is my favourite language
-   📒 JavaScript (+ TypeScript): React, Next
-   🤖 Robot Framework: For all of my testing needs (including making coffee lol)
-   🖼️ Tailwind CSS
-   🐋 Docker: For starting projects
